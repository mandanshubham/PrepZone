## Bellman Ford Algorithm
* Bellman Ford Algorithm is used to find **Shortest Distance** between **Source Node** and all other nodes.
* This algorithm can be used for both Directed as well as Undirected Graph.
* This algorithm can also handle negative weight edges in case of **Directed Graph** but not in case of **Undirected Graph**.
* Graph must not contain **Negative Cycle**

### Time and Space Complexity
* Time Complexity : O(EN)
* Space Complexity : O(N)
* E - number of edges, N - number of nodes.
