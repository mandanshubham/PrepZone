## Dijkstra algorith
* Dijkstra algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm.
* Here, single-source means that only one source is given, and we have to find the shortest path from the source to all the nodes.
* This algorithm works for both directed and un-directed graph.
* Dijkstra’s algorithm doesn’t work for graphs with negative weight edges.
* For graphs with negative weight edges, [Bellman–Ford algorithm](https://github.com/mandanshubham/PrepZone/tree/main/Graph/Bellman%20Ford%20Algorithm) can be used
