# Segment Tree
A Segment Tree is a Complete Binary Tree

## Complete Binary Tree
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which all the levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest one, which is filled from the left. A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
